Project 6 for MSCH C220

This is empty with a license and a readme to acquire full credit based off the alternatives provided by our professor. I wish I had enough time to finish the project, but other matters came up. As a sidenote to professor Francis, Thank you for an amazing semester and working so hard to share your passion with your students. I'm honored to have had the ability to be one of your students. Thank you!
